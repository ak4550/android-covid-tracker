# android-covid-tracker

An app to track the country dead, recover and infected people
it uses retrofit along with gson and gson-converter
#### Api Used
`https://api.covid19api.com/`

I didn't implement all the country, you can do it by simply going to <br>
`https://api.covid19api.com/countries` <br>
it will return all country list just set up the spinner accordingly

or you can use search bar instead of spinner(drop-down menu)
